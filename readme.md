## Simple Carousel

## a music app to implement carousel and animation in react native expo.

for this app i am using [FSD (Feature Sliced Design) Architecture](https://feature-sliced.design/).

features are sliced into different folder :

- shared for common things that can be shared between pages like (UI, constant, lib function)
- features for things that will be interact by user
- widget is collection of features
- entities for data handling

---

for animation part i am using Reanimated and Gesture Handler Library. Reanimated provide easy Layout Animation (entering, exiting) without making complex calculation and also can be use to make custom animation
